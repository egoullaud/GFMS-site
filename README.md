## Introduction

# Landing Page for Client made with React and TailwindCSS

I coded up this landing page to practice using React with TailwindCSS and to mock up a landing page for a client.

## Getting Started

# Install React & create react app

```bash
npm create-react-app project_name
cd my-project
```

# Install TailwindCSS

I recommend simply copy pasting the installation instructions from https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

You will need to configure some files, just follow the instructions in the TailwindCSS documentation.

## Technologies and Features

- React & JSX
- React Icons
- TailwindCSS
- Git & Github
- Use State

## Reflections

I built this fairly quickly (over a few hours). I wanted to get more hands-on experience with TailwindCSS, and see how it compares to using Bootstrap 5. I will say, I am enjoying TailwindCSS more than Bootstrap 5, as it feels more customizable.
